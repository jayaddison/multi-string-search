    """
    This class will implement a Set Backwards Oracle Matching (SBOM) factor
    oracle; it's a datastructure constructed from a collection of text patterns
    used to match against text documents.

    Roughly speaking, the oracle is a directed graph of state transitions, with
    each transition corresponding to a single character read during document
    matching.  The maximum length of any path in the graph is no greater than
    the maximum length of the largest input pattern -- and each paths is
    created from a _reversed_ representation of the corresponding pattern.

    Conversely, we can read-ahead by at least the _minimum_-length pattern
    in the pattern collection from the start of the string and also any other
    time that we encounter a position from which no patterns could possibly
    match.

    So, if our patterns are "twelve", "notes", and "food", and we attempt a
    match of those patterns against a document "food products", we can begin by
    looking at character 4 (the min-length pattern, "food", has length 4) in
    the document, and our oracle would begin matching from the character "d",
    proceeding through two reverse steps of "o" and "o" before finding a
    terminal state (complete string match found) of "f".

       E -> V -> L -> E -> W -> T

       S -> E -> T -> O -> N

       D -> O -> O -> F

    For these example patterns we don't have much overlap between the input
    patterns; when overlapping patterns do exist, the oracle factor's graph
    consolidates (de-duplicates) the overlapping parts.
